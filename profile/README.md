Welcome to the **TeamTomo** GitHub organization.

*modular Python packages the cryo-ET community can depend on*

## Mission

To help the cryo-ET community develop their ideas without reinventing the software stack.

## Key ideas

- packages are small and modular
- scope is both limited and well defined
- analysis is kept separate from IO
- wrappers around external software take in-memory objects
- APIs are [Pythonic](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/) and [type hinted](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)
- code is [tested](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/)

If this seems daunting, we're [here to help](https://forum.image.sc/)!

## Development model

Because packages in *teamtomo* are small and well scoped it is easy to 
depend on only those packages relevant to your work. 

*teamtomo* is **not** a place for the development of your own software projects. 
Your projects belong to you and the credit should be yours alone! 
Did you develop a small, reusable component along the way that could benefit the 
entire community? We would love to work with you to bring it here.
