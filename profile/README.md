Welcome to the **TeamTomo** GitHub organization.

*Small, reusable packages that enable working with cryo-electron tomography data*

## Core concepts
The idea of this organization is to provide small, reusable components the cryo-ET Python community can depend on.

With that in mind our requirements are...
- packages are small and well scoped
- analysis sis separate from IO
- wrappers in memory objects, not paths to files
- APIs are [Pythonic](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/)
- code is [tested](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/)

If this seems daunting, we're [here to help](https://forum.image.sc/)!
